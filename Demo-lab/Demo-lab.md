# Hands-on Lab: Analyze AI Opportunities During the Product Concept Phase

**Estimated duration:** 30 minutes

## Introduction

The purpose of a product concept is to identify a potential solution that addresses an identified problem or market need. Happy Homes Inc. produces a variety of household cleaners in a highly competitive market. Customers expect household cleaners that are reasonably priced, environmentally safe, and perform as advertised.

## Problem or Challenges

- Development of less toxic housecleaners requires extensive research, testing, and formulation. Happy Homes currently relies on trial-and-error methods that can be time-consuming and costly. Happy Homes is looking for a solution that ensures effectiveness while minimizing toxicity. This is a delicate balance.
- A product manager believes implementing a generative AI solution may enhance the current product development process. They need to determine how Generative AI can improve the current development process and present the business case to leadership for approval.

## The Current Development Process

- **Step 1:** Product research. Scientists study existing chemicals and their effects on health and the environment.
- **Step 2:** Marketing researches competitor products and assesses their advantages and disadvantages. They conduct marketing research to determine the product lifecycle stage of each competitor product and how they compare to the firm\'s products.
- **Step 3:** Chemists experiment with various ingredients to create safe and effective cleaners.
- **Step 4:** New products are developed, analyzed, and tested. Refinements are made as necessary to ensure health, safety, and cleaning effectiveness.
- **Step 5:** Product refinements are made based on test results. Product feasibility is evaluated, and business cases are developed.
- **Step 6:** Approved products go into mass production and are entered into a variety of distribution channels.
